# Retrieve

Retrieves the squads v4 program. For example, retrieve the staging program via
```
cargo run --release -p retrieve -- program squadsv4 STAG3xkFMyVK3sRtQhipsKuLpRGbgospDpVdNyJqDpS
```
which will save the program .so execuable to `auxiliary/tests/fixtures/squadsv4.so` at the root of the workspace.
